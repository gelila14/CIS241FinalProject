I am originally an Eritrean; <a href="../images/eritreamap.png" target="_blank"> Eritrea</a> is a<br/> country in the horn of east Africa. I came to United States of America 4 years ago. Currently I am<br/> a student at Edmonds College. My goal is to be software developer in the near future.<br/>

          <br/>Through my passion for computers, I have a keen interest in programming, Desktop support &<br/> networking in the vast field of IT. I am currently completing the certificate degree in Web <br/>Developer Certificate. As a part-time job, I work in the IT Help desk department of Edmonds <br/>college. <br/>

          <br/>Apart from the above, I like to travel, visit <a href="interests.html#historical-placess">historical placess</a>, experiencing different culture and<br/> also enjoy reading books, watching movies, swimming and most importantly spending time with <br/>my family. <br/>

         <br/>My five-years plan of my life includes getting a bachelorâ€™s degree in software development and<br/> working at one of the fortune 100 companies. In addition, I envisage myself to be a role model to<br/> women and minorities by being a good example and contributions to society. <br/>
